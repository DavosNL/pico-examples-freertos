# pico-examples-freertos

This repository provides clean, minimal examples of using FreeRTOS SMP with the Raspberry Pi Pico W, including Wi-Fi connectivity and lwIP-based networking â€” all written in pure C. It aims to serve as a starting point for developers who want full control over their embedded networking stack without relying on Arduino or MicroPython abstractions.
